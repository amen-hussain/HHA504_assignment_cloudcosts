### Assignment: Exploring Cost Management and Billing on Azure and GCP

The objective of this assignment is to introduce you to the cost management and billing interfaces of Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By the end of this assignment, you will be able to navigate these platforms to understand how cloud costs are tracked and managed.

### 1. Explore the Cost Management Dashboards

#### Azure:

To monitor costs and set budgets or alerts, I would navigate to the tabs on the left under "monitoring."

#### GCP:

Here, I was able to navigate to the Billing Overview and Reports section and understand how cost data is presented. 

### 2. Set up a Hypothetical Budget

#### Azure: 
<img width="1521" alt="budget" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdcca709-8331-4992-a06d-4fc1dfaaab2e">

I was easily able to set a monthly budget of $8. 

<img width="1182" alt="budget2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf49803-54d0-4ea1-ad59-3904cabb749f">

I was able to set a forecasted alert for when my spending reaches 80% of my budget of $8. 

#### GCP: 
<img width="1543" alt="Gbudget" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc78fd1e-dbe5-43f9-97dd-81f7f48b119f">

<img width="1543" alt="gbudget2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7594df51-30f2-488a-b0f0-dc7ef9fe6f4b">

Under Budgets and Alerts, I was able to create a montly budget of $8.

I was then able to create an alert when my costs approached the budget limit or 100% of the budget. 

### 3. Investigate Cost Management Features

#### Azure: 

To forecast future costs based on a budget, there are multiple options. For example, under Cost Management, there is a tab titled Cost Analysis, that allows a user to "Report on and analyze your cloud costs and review key insights to better understand and control spending patterns...each view breaks your cost down to help you understand what you're spending and where." This allows for a user to make predictions based on past data. Furthermore, a user may navigate to the Advisor Recommendations tab that serves to "optimize and reduce your overall Azure spend by identifying idle and underutilized resources." Additionally, in the Overview tab in the Cost Management section, there are shortcuts that offer the option to "Report on and analyze trends" and "Control and optimize costs." 

#### GCP: 

The "Cost Breakdown" shows a users "base usage cost" and how it has been "affected by any credits, adjustments, and taxes." Under this tab a user may also view reports on cost breakdowns and navigate through custom time periods. Like shown previously, the "Budgets & Alerts" allows a user to create personalized budgets for specific projects or services, as well as set alerts when a certain limit is reached. 

There are many "Recommendations" given under GCP for Cloud Billing Documentation. For example a help document titled "create, edit, or delete budgets and budget alerts." I think this document is very informative as it gives a in depth/detailed step by step on how to budget on GCP. There is also a training titled "Understanding your Google Cloud costs." Additionally there are videos on "Google Cloud billing, cost management, and advanced topics." 

### A brief explanation of the cost management features you found most interesting or useful.

I think an interesting feature in the Billing section of GCP is "FinOps hub." This feature essentially serves as a snapshot for billing. It displays savings from the prior month, active recommendations, and potential savings. It highlights any high-priority tasks a user may have, which aids in organization. Furthermore, it scores a user on their "FinOps maturity" which shows how well a user utilizes Google Cloud tools and follows FinOps practices.
